## How it works: 
Input accounts similar to your theme page and this bot will search the most recent posts on those pages. With each post that it observes it evaluates it with a model that takes into account likes,
and the time that the post was made. If it is deemed to be a "viral" post by the bot it will be given a score 1-100. Then it will display the most viral posts ranked in descending order
(best posts at the top) with links and images of each post!
